# GEM Summoner Backend

[![UIUC ECE 484](https://img.shields.io/badge/Course-ECE%20484-orange)](https://ece.illinois.edu/)

Flask-based API for the **GEM Summoner** project, serving as the bridge between the web frontend and the vehicleâ€™s ROS-based control system. It manages live GPS locations, summon targets, and vehicle status updates.

## Contribution
This project was fully authored and developed by Steffen Brown, including all code implementation, experimentation, and documentation.

## Features
- **Authentication** via a simple token-based system  
- **Phone location tracking** for summon target  
- **Car location tracking** for live vehicle position  
- **Car status management** (`IDLE`, `SUMMONING`, `ARRIVED`)  
- **CORS-enabled** for seamless communication with the React frontend
